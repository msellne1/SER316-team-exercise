There once was a hund who lived in Berlin.
One day he walked down the hauptstrasse.
There was a delicious smell in the air which he decided to follow.
As he continued on, he passed the ratskeller.
Eventually, it led him to the baeckerei.
He discovered that the source of the smell was gebaeck.
In particular, apfelkuchen, his favorite.
He attempted to enter, but the door was schloss.
So, he knocked and a man who appeared to be a baker wearing lederhose answered.
He let him in the klimaanlage bakery and offered him a gebaeck which made him a very happy hund.
As a very happy hund, he trotted toward the Klimaanlage Bier Garten across the Hauptstrasse.
He was almost hit by two racing autos, a BMW and a Porsche going sehr schnell on the Hauptstrasse!
Luckily he was saved by a man with no lederhose.
