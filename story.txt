There once was a hund who lived in Berlin.
One day he walked down the hauptstrasse.
There was a delicious smell in the air which he decided to follow.
As he continued on, he passed the ratskeller.
Eventually, it led him to the baeckerei.
He discovered that the source of the smell was gebaeck.
In particular, apfelkuchen, his favorite.
He attempted to enter, but the door was schloss.
So, he knocked and a man who appeared to be a baker wearing lederhose answered.
He let him in the klimaanlage bakery and offered him a gebaeck which made him a very happy hund.
As a very happy hund, he trotted toward the Klimaanlage Bier Garten across the Hauptstrasse.
He was almost hit by two racing autos, a BMW and a Porsche going sehr schnell on the Hauptstrasse!
He decided that it was too dangerous so stay on the road, he jogged to the sidewalk where he discovered a dropped Bradwurst
He thought to himself: maybe God wanted to treat me after almost getting killed. He started to chomp on the sausage
A couple feet away from the Bradwurst, there was a piece of Brot. "Today must be my lucky day!"
He jogged happily to the brot and started to lick it, however two officers with badges that says "Berlin Animal Control" tackled him
He was taken into a car, and they are heading to the Flughafen
He was put in the storage area, and he saw a label that says "Destination: Raesfeld"
I don't want to go back to Raesfeld, that's where Professor Mehlhase lives!
She always tries to dress me up in a Dirndel!
